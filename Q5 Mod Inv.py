# d = 1: (3 * 1) mod 13 = 3
# d = 2: (3 * 2) mod 13 = 6
# d = 3: (3 * 3) mod 13 = 9
# d = 4: (3 * 4) mod 13 = 12
# d = 5: (3 * 5) mod 13 = 2
# d = 6: (3 * 6) mod 13 = 5
# d = 7: (3 * 7) mod 13 = 8
# d = 8: (3 * 8) mod 13 = 11
# d = 9: (3 * 9) mod 13 = 1

# From the calculations, we see that when d = 9, (3 * d) mod 13 gives us 1. Therefore, the modular inverse of 3 modulo 13 is 9.
